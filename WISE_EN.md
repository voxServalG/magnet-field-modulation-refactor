## Preamble: Declaration on Instrumental Rationality and Techno-Ethics

This software is forged to serve the vibrant lived reality of humanity, not the sterile logic of algorithms. By obtaining this software, the user acknowledges and endorses the following principles:

- **Rejection of Alienation via Instrumental Rationality:** Technology must be a means for human emancipation, not an end for enslavement. We oppose reducing human beings to mere data nodes, logistical units, or traffic metrics.

- **Vigilance Against the "Malicious Triangle" and the Encroachment of the Complicit STEM Elite*:** We vigilantly oppose utilizing technological means to exacerbate educational anxiety, facilitate financial predation, or weave information cocoons.

- **The Subjectivity of the People:** True wisdom resides in the praxis of the working people. This software shall not be used to construct any system that disdains the masses or exploits information asymmetry for predatory extraction.

## *The Malicious Triangle and the Domestic Polytech/PhD Elite*

**"The Malicious Triangle"** refers to the structural closed loop within China's current digital society that obstructs the equitable distribution of technology and induces systemic alienation. It is constituted by three mutually reinforcing vertices:

- **Alienated Selection:** Represented by the "Information Olympiad" complex and score-obsessed education. It castrates the intellect of youth, collapsing "creative exploration" to "extreme test-taking capability," thereby mass-producing technocrats devoid of humanism and governed solely by instrumental rationality.

- **The Terminal of Exploitation:** Represented by ByteDance-esque internet giants and domestic AI corporations. They devour the top-tier "Test-taking Automatons" (Zuotijia) not to alleviate public suffering, but to engineer ultimate traffic algorithms and human-efficiency management systems, treating the public as data feedstock for precision harvesting.

- **Pathological Drive:** Represented by a societal mentality of extreme risk aversion. It weaponizes survival anxiety and the fear of class freefall to coerce the entire society into the aforementioned meat grinder, strangling any innovation or resistance that deviates from the mainstream.

**Domestic Polytech/PhD Elite** are the actual operators and conspirators of this system.

* Domesticated within a 'feudal guild-like' academic silo, they wield advanced technical prowess, yet their capacity for empathy toward the lived reality has atrophied amidst long-term, hermetic conditioning.

* They are addicted to the logical elegance of technology itself (Technological Fundamentalism), arrogantly dismissing "humans" as variables that disrupt system efficiency.

* They perceive themselves as disciples of science, but are in reality blind executors of instrumental rationality.

* It is they who hand-coded the algorithms that imprison the masses; they serve as the cold, efficient, and unquestionable transmission shaft connecting greedy capital with the exploited public.

* These three forces conspire, executed by this STEM elite, to stymie the Communist Party of China's founding mission of 'Serving the People', codifying instead a tech-assisted system of anti-people exploitation.
